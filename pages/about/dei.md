# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Statement

FAIROS-HEP is committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for
everyone from all backgrounds not limited to political views, religion,
national or ethnic origin, race, color, sexual orientation, gender identity or
expression, age, marital status, veteran status, disability, research
discipline, history of conviction or incarceration, socioeconomic status, and
educational history. The entire team strives to create an environment that
makes interactions and collaborations enjoyable and fulfilling while
eliminating discrimination, harassment, exploitation, and intimidation.

We aim to promote the following best practices with regard to diversity, 
equity, and inclusion:

* Affirm that promoting diversity must be consistent, ongoing, and is an active
  process that requires engagement;
* Promote awareness of perspectives that may have been previously inaccessible
  (or less prominent) to groups traditionally represented in scientific
  research environments;
* Believe that diversification requires cultural, experiential, and ideological
  representation as well as increasing the number of researchers and staff from
  underrepresented groups; and
* Aim to foster an environment where all perspectives are valued because they
  serve to advance the Instituteâ€™s academic excellence and intellectual
  capacity, and will contribute to a more productive and respectful
  professional environment.
