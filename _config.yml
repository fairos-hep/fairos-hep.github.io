title: FAIR and Open Science for High Energy Physics

description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  The FAIROS-HEP research coordination network will foster the adoption of practices and cyberinfrastructure to enable reuse and reinterpretation of high energy physics (HEP) datasets. A key mechanism that the project seeks to cultivate is that of "living publications", distributed objects where the description of scientific results, the data on which they are based, and the computational procedures used to generate them are all available for examination, reproduction, and reuse. This and other mechanisms which the RCN would foster would facilitate distributed, asynchronous reuse of HEP research products, by means of a combined infrastructure supporting publications, data, software, analysis and workflow preservation. FAIROS-HEP builds on longstanding collaboration among the stakeholders of the extended HEP community.
